# NIRS-Ontology: An Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care 

This repository contains the **NIRS Ontology**, developed to support knowledge representation in acute care settings. It integrates ventilation modalities, therapy parameters, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes using standardized vocabularies and rule-based reasoning.
